            time
            I
            wrote my first "Hello World", I would have never imagined that would turn into such an amazing journey

            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
            <p>I have lived in NC for almost my whole life. I enjoy reading and watching movies or shows like GOT.
                Although recently I have have been getting more into outside activies. I want to learn how to box
                and I
                will try to learn how to snowboard next year.

                Although I really love doing those things my true passion lies in coding. I am always trying to
                improve
                my skills by building cool projects. I enjoy learning new techonologies and im currently trying to
                become a master the art of python</p>
